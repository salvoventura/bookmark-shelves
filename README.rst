Bookmark Shelves
################
An open source browser addon/extension to organize the content of the entire Bookmarks Toolbar content into shelves, that can be swapped at will.

Why this tool
=============
My Bookmarks Toolbar is full of folders that actually belong to different areas of interests and projects. While each folder is well organized, I still have a visually cluttered toolbar.
With **Bookmark Shelves** I can create virtual shelves based on areas of interests and projects, and only keep there the relevant bookmarks and folders. When I am done with a project, I can swap to another shelf.

Background
==========
Anyone working on multiple projects, or with different areas of interest, generating tons of bookmarks, will eventually end up with a cluttered Bookmarks Toolbar. This addon/extension helps manage that.


############
Installation
############

Mozilla Firefox
===============
`<https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/bookmark-shelves/>`_

#####
USAGE
#####
Once installed, a new icon button will appear in the browser toolbar. The tooltip displays **Bookmark Shelves**. Click on the button, and a popup will open.

At first run, you are given the option to create your first shelf. After you input a name and press **Save**, your current Bookmarks Toolbar content is stored in a shelf with the chosen name. Next time you click, the interface will show you a select box with a list of shelves. In this case, you will only have one. The list grows as you create more shelves.

Now that you have done your first run, you can do any of the following:

 - create a new shelf
 - switch between shelves
 - update the active shelf

As you have more shelves, you can easily switch between them by simply selecting their name on the pull-down list.

.. note:: Input in the **Create new folder** box will have precedence over any selected value.

Development

This is my second take at browser addon development, and while it is a very simple one, I (still) learned a lot in the process, not without frustrations. You are welcome to use it as a base for your suggestions and enhancement, which I would love to incorporate as they come.
